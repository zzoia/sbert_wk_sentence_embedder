# Python World

This is some example code that is part of a [blog post on using GitHub (or other providers) as a PyPi Server](
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-use-github-as-a-pypi-server-1c3b0d07db2).

This repository defines a very simple package that just has a function that returns "world".
